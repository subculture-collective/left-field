          <p>
            A research index of seats in Congress, governorships, and state
            legislatures. Each seat is scored from public election, geography,
            and campaign-finance records, and every score shows the inputs
            behind it. Start with the <Link href="/">Priority Index</Link>, or{" "}
            <Link prefetch={false} href="/browse">browse the factual seat records</Link>{" "}
            for the House and Senate.

          <h2>How to read a score</h2>
          <dl>
            <dt>A score is a research priority</dt>
            <dd>
              It orders where investigation may be most useful. It is not a
              forecast, a poll, or an endorsement.
            </dd>
            <dt>Evidence varies by seat</dt>
            <dd>
              Each seat says how many inputs were measured. An input with no
              retained data reads “Not in this score” and is never counted as
              zero.
            </dd>
            <dt>Ties are shown as ties</dt>
            <dd>
              Seats with the same score share one rank. Seats scored on a
              single input often tie, so the index opens on seats with two or
              more.

              The LF mark sets an L and an F on one baseline, with a rust
              square where they meet. The square is not a ballot, a result, or
              a certification symbol, and a seat&apos;s rank does not imply
              an endorsement by any organization.
